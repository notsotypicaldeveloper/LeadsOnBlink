# Leads On Blink

- We are creating an application that help end user to buy top lead email info registered on portal.

- User have to pay via razorpay, so that he/she can see the selected lead details.

- Frontend deployed on: https://leads-on-blink.vercel.app/


# Backend is kept closed, to avoid extra server charges.
- For running backend, simply create .env, simply create following variables and set them, then simpy run 
"npm run dev"
